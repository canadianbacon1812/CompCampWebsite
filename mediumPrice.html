  <!--jesus!!! look up 1050ti you dumb-fuck, its not that hard. p.s. ur rounded or something of the such, im not going to do that here, but, ya know-->
  <p>The 1060 6gb is the better version of the 1060. It has a 1607 base clock, and this is the dual fan ssc version, so it will not over-heat as easily. Although at a steeper price than a 3gb or a 1050ti, it is cheaper than a 1070, and only has 2 less gb,
    although the difference in cores is a bit, they have a similair base clock. The extra two or three gb and the extra clock will boost your gaming or visual arts capability.

  <!-- get a pic of an i3 6100 and 7100 and 7350k, and put them side by side, not in a circle form, rounded will be fine.-->
  <!-- this is piston broke garage, not chip foose, so for the motherboard, get like an h110, and not a good one. power supply, an evga 450w will work fine, and a small coolmaster micro atx will be fuckin' fantastic, ram, just get some low level ddr4 or somthin', hdd, get a wd 1 tb hard drive for 60 buckaroos.-->
  <!-- price should be around 687$-->
  <p>The i5 6600k skylake is somewhat of a outdated graphics card, with the new kaby-lake architecture coming in, but other than the fact that a new i5 has come out, it is still a perfecly good processor, and is a "k" processor, so it will overclock without
    troubles. Although a pricy cpu, it will overclock to 3.9 GHz.
