<img class="center-tag-not" src="images/1050ti.jpg" alt="picture of the graphics card <<1050ti>>"/>
 <!--jesus!!! look up 1050ti you dumb-fuck, its not that hard. p.s. ur rounded or something of the such, im not going to do that here, but, ya know-->
<p>this is 1050ti, a graphics card which is cheaper than a 1060 3gb or 6gb, and has 4 gb of vram, and works very well for a 200 dollar card (170 on black friday), you don't want a 1050ti cause you think it is not good enough for you, get the f*** out, what do you think this is, chip foose? no! your piston broke garage. go get yourself one for you budget build, i got one for 170 bucks, runs most games at atleast 60 frames.</p>
<img class="center-tag-not" src="images/i3k.jpg" alt=" cpus"/>
 <!-- get a pic of an i3 6100 and 7100 and 7350k, and put them side by side, not in a circle form, rounded will be fine.-->
<!-- this is piston broke garage, not chip foose, so for the motherboard, get like an h110, and not a good one. power supply, an evga 450w will work fine, and a small coolmaster micro atx will be fuckin' fantastic, ram, just get some low level ddr4 or somthin', hdd, get a wd 1 tb hard drive for 60 buckaroos.-->
<!-- price should be around 687$-->
<p>The i3 7350k is part of the new line, and the new architecture of kaby lake. it is an overclockable card that is the cheapest k series. although it does not have 4 cores, it has 4 logical core, and is hyper-threaded to impersonate 4 cores. It will do for this build.</p>
<img class="center-tag-not" src="images/h110.jpg" alt="h110 motherboard"/>
<p>This is part of gigabytes h110 lines. It is a cheap but effective version, named the "h110-a." it is 70 dollars, and supports ddr4 and goes all 10 yards. This will do.</p>
<img class="center-tag-not" src="images/hdd.jpg" alt="a hdd made by wd"/>
<p>this is a 1tb hdd made by wd, spinning in at 7200rpm, which is not ssd speeds, but will do.</p>
<img class="center-tag-not" src="images/case.jpg" alt=" a rosewill micro atx SRM-01 case"/>
<p>This is the Rosewill micro atx SRM-01, a cheap and usefull little case. it has one 80mm fan will do just fine, and has plenty of ventelation, not that you need much for a 1050ti.</p>
<img class="center-tag-not" src="images/430w.jpg" alt="a evga 430w power supply"/>
<img class="center-tag-not" src="images/ddr4.jpg" alt="ddr4"/>
<p>this is the CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x 8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3200MHz (PC4-25600) C16 Memory Kit - Black, it is 8gb of ddr4, and it is good</p>
<p>the final cost should be around 687 dollars cad.</p> <p> paragrphing</p>
